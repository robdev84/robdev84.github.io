<p>Do you live at an uncorporated address? The West Chicago Fire Department has a high-visibility address sign to install on your mailbox to help emergency crews find your address easily in case of an emergency. The Fire Department will install the signs throughout the Spring of 2018. You can see when they will be in your neighborhood here: <a href="">Schedule</a>. Prior to installing, the fire department will knock on your door to receive permission, however, if you use the form to give your authorization, your sign will be installed. You can give your permission here: <a href="">Signs.</a> </p>
